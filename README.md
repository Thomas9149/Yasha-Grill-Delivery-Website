#### User orders & MongoDB Database
- The status field of orders in the **orders** table is defined as follows:
```javascript
const getStatusText = (status) => {
  switch(status) {
    case 0: 
      return "Preparing";
    case 1:
      return "Ready for Pickup";
    case 2:
      return "Out for Delivery";
    case 3:
      return "Completed";
    default:
      return "Unknown";
  }
};
```
- The delivery of orders in the **orders** table is defined as follows:
```javascript
const getDeliveryStatus = (delivery) => {
    switch(delivery) {
      case 0:
        return "No";
      case 1:
        return "Delivery";
      default:
        return "Unknown";
    }
};
```
- The status of **payAtCollect** in the **orders** table is defined as follows:
```javascript
const getPayAtCollectStatus = (payAtCollect) => {
    switch(payAtCollect) {

db.orders.updateMany(
   {},
   { $set: { delivery: 0 } }
)
```
